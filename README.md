## I try to
- Strictly use TDD to write my solutions.
- Write clean, readable and reusable code.
- Promote idiomatic Python.
- Write fast enough code.
- Make it all the way.
- Come up with my own solutions from scratch unless really stuck.
- Get a good nights sleep.
- Have fun!

## I try not to
- Compete with anyone other than myself.
- Optimize speed beyond the scope of a silly puzzle.
- Overwork a working solution.
